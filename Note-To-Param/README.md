# Note-To-Param 

Using these devices is fairly simple. 

Put the sender on a MIDI track, and dial in your values as described by the "Usage" section. 
Put the receiver oh the track containing the device you want to control and use the "Map" button to connect it to a parameter.


Thanks to [@okhick](https://github.com/okhick/) for [MapButton.maxpat](https://github.com/okhick/MaxMSP-Tools/blob/master/MapButton.maxpat), which made building this device a whole lot easier.
